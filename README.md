Greetings reader, this project is called the Hydration Hero. It uses an Arduino Mega, a 4x4 Keypad, a 16x2 LCD, a soil moisture sensor, and a photoresistor. The LCD displays a welcome message and asks the user how many plants to be measured. After giving the input, the soil moisture sensor at the bottom of the device measures values and sends an output in terms of a percent. Similarly, the photoresistor at the top of the device detects the amount of light falling on the plant and sends an output. To take a new reading for a different plant, the user has to press “#” on the keypad. This real-time process occurs for the n number of plants that the user inputs. After all the readings are taken, the device tells the user which plants need water and which ones need more sunlight. 

This device/idea can be used as a part of a large network. Instead of individually assessing the plants, this device can accurately tell the user which plants require what conditions, while doing everything remotely. 

All sensors have been individually calibrated to my surroundings. If you are to try and create this yourself, I suggest you re-calibrate them and adjust the values in the code accordingly.
